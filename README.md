Mission

You have to develop a React Native app that will work in both iOS and Android platforms. For convenience we are only going to test the app in iOS iPhone simulator. Your app will query a local JSON file and call a third party API to fetch the data and display in the app.
Open Weather Map API

We are going to be using a third party API to get the required data. It requires you to create an account in them and subscribe you to their API. Follow the link below to register an account:

https://openweathermap.org

Once you are registered you need to subscribe to Current Weather data API in the following link:

https://openweathermap.org/api

You would have to read the API docs for the specific API. The following link helps you to understand API more:
